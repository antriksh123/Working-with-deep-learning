## Fraud Detection using Self-Organising Maps
In this project, we develop a fraud detection system using Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs). SOMs are unsupervised neural networks that can identify patterns and clusters in data. We train a SOM model on a large dataset of customer transactions and use it to classify new transactions as either fraudulent or non-fraudulent. By leveraging the SOM's ability to capture the underlying structure of the data, we can detect anomalous patterns that indicate potential fraud.

## Hybrid Deep Learning Model 
This project introduces a hybrid deep learning model that combines Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) for improved fraud detection. The process begins with SOMs labeling the data and identifying customers with potential fraud. The labeled data is then further trained with ANNs to enhance the model's ability to identify if a new customer may engage in fraudulent activities. By combining the strengths of SOMs and ANNs, the hybrid model achieves higher accuracy and better performance.
